# Coursera Machine Learning

Its a repository for assignments and projects needed to complete the course. Its for personal reference and for public learning.

The assignments and projects cover:
1. ex1 - Raw implementation of Linear Regression
2. ex2 - Raw implementation of Logistic Regression
3. ex3 - Handwriting Recognition using multi-class classification in Logistic Regression
4. ex4 - Handwriting Recogniton using 2-Layer Neural Networks
5. ex5 - Implementation of Regularization to eliminate high variance on "Water Level Prediction using rainfall" data.
6. ex6 - Built a Spam Classifier using Support Vector Machine
7. ex7 - Image Compression and Reconstruction using K-Means and implementation of Principal Component Analysis to train Neural Network faster on Handwriting recognition data.
8. ex8 - Built an anomaly detector and a simple recommender system using Collaborative Filtering Learning Algorithm
